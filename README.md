# Synfo

Synfo is a browser sytem details checker, that checks system information provided by the browser, as well as browser capabilites information.
Made in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. All of the UI was designed from scratch, similar to most of my other projects.

## Functions

Synfo is made using a lot of functions, all of which can be called. Check the code for the function names(although most start with 'get' or 'check'). You can call them from the console as well.
